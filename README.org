* Mate mode
Small Emacs package to handle a mate (ðŸ§‰) round.

** Usage
- ~M-x~ ~mate-mode-start-mate-circle~
  - Starts the mate round; will prompt the user for every person present in the round. Will also create a buffer called ~*mate-mode*~ which will hold the state. It's mainly intended for the package to modify; although it /can/ be manipulated manually as long as the state is maintained consistent.
- ~M-x~ ~mate-mode-add-new-drinker~
  - Will prompt for a new drinker; and will be added to the end of the round.
- ~M-x~ ~mate-mode-next-mate-drinker~
  - Will pass the mate to the next drinker and will show the new drinker in the mini-buffer.
- ~M-x~ ~mate-mode-no-more-mate~
  - Will remove the *current* user from the mate round.
  - In reality, the user is marked with the â›” in the ~*mate-mode*~ buffer; the emoji can be replaced for a space to re-introduce the user to the mate round.
- ~M-x~ ~mate-mode-whos-turn-it-is~
  - Shows the current drinker in the mini-buffer.

** Special thanks
I want to dedicate this small package to my companions in wizardry, the gang also known as the "Doctors of reality":
- Dami, the warlock
- Dylan, the alchemist
- Lean, the sorcerer
- Tomi, the mage

And last, but certainly not least, I want to shout-out our magical mentor:
- Fercho, the grand wizard; holder of truth, good ideas and an even greater heart.
  - Whilst using only 1% of his magical abilities, he conjured a port of this plugin, written in Elixir (magical language) with a fully fledged GUI. Linked here: https://github.com/fborello-lambda/quiero_mate
  - Your influence is everlasting. Godspeed Fercho!

Keep it real ðŸ¤˜
